> Membrane Framework - if you asked me what it is, I have no idea. _- Jose Valim in [ElixirConf 2018 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7TWMFtDwHg&feature=youtu.be&t=11m18s)_

Multimedia processing framework that focuses on reliability, concurrency and scalability.

An easy to use abstraction layer for assembling mostly server-side applications that have to consume, produce or process multimedia streams.

It puts reliability over amount of features.

It is written in Elixir + C with outstanding Erlang VM underneath that gives us a rock solid and battle tested foundation.
