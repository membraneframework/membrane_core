  Event is an entity that can be sent between elements.

  Events can flow either downstream or upstream - they can be sent with
  `t:Membrane.Element.Action.event/0`, and can be handled in
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.handle_event/4`. Each event is
  to implement `Membrane.EventProtocol`, which allows to configure its behaviour.
