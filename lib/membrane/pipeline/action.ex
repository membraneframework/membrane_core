  Returning actions is a way of pipeline interaction with

  does not support returning any actions) unless explicitly stated otherwise.

  Action that instantiates children and links them according to `Membrane.ParentSpec`.

  Starts a timer that will invoke `c:Membrane.Pipeline.handle_tick/3` callback
  every `interval` according to the given `clock`.

  The timer's `id` is passed to the `c:Membrane.Pipeline.handle_tick/3`
  callback and can be used for changing its interval via `t:timer_interval_t/0`
  or stopping it via `t:stop_timer_t/0`.

  If `interval` is set to `:no_interval`, the timer won't issue any ticks until
  the interval is set with `t:timer_interval_t/0` action.

  If no `clock` is passed, pipeline clock is chosen.

  Timers use `Process.send_after/3` under the hood.

  Changes interval of a timer started with `t:start_timer_t/0`.

  If the `interval` is `:no_interval`, the timer won't issue any ticks until
  another `t:timer_interval_t/0` action. Otherwise, the timer will issue ticks every
  new `interval`. The next tick after interval change is scheduled at
  `new_interval + previous_time`, where previous_time is the time of the latest
  tick or the time of returning `t:start_timer_t/0` action if no tick has been
  sent yet. Note that if `current_time - previous_time > new_interval`, a burst
  of `div(current_time - previous_time, new_interval)` ticks is issued immediately.
