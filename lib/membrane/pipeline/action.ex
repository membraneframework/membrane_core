  Action that manages the end of the component setup.

  By default, component setup ends with the end of `c:Membrane.Pipeline.handle_setup/2` callback.
  If `{:setup, :incomplete}` is returned there, setup lasts until `{:setup, :complete}`
  is returned from antoher callback.

  Untils the setup lasts, the component won't enter `:playing` playback.

  Starts a timer that will invoke `c:Membrane.Pipeline.handle_tick/3` callback

  The timer's `id` is passed to the `c:Membrane.Pipeline.handle_tick/3`
  callback and can be used for changing its interval via `t:timer_interval/0`
  or stopping it via `t:stop_timer/0`.

  If `interval` is set to `:no_interval`, the timer won't issue any ticks until
  the interval is set with `t:timer_interval/0` action.

  Changes interval of a timer started with `t:start_timer/0`.

  If the `interval` is `:no_interval`, the timer won't issue any ticks until

  new `interval`. The next tick after interval change is scheduled at
  `new_interval + previous_time`, where previous_time is the time of the latest
  tick or the time of returning `t:start_timer/0` action if no tick has been

  Terminates the pipeline with given reason.

  Termination reason follows the OTP semantics:
  - Use `:normal` for graceful termination. If the pipeline has no children, it terminates
  immediately. Otherwise, it switches to the zombie mode, requests all the children to terminate,
  waits for them to terminate and then terminates itself. In the zombie mode, no pipeline callbacks
  are called and all messages and calls to the pipeline are ignored (apart from Membrane internal
  messages)
  - If the reason is other than `:normal`, the pipeline terminates immediately. The pipeline supervisor
  terminates all the children with the reason `:shutdown`
  - If the reason is neither `:normal`, `:shutdown` nor `{:shutdown, term}`, an error is logged
