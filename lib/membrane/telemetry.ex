defmodule Membrane.Telemetry do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines basic telemetry event types used by Membrane's Core.
  Membrane uses [Telemetry Package](https://hex.pm/packages/telemetry) for instrumentation and does not store or save any measurements by itself.

  It is user's responsibility to use some sort of metrics reporter
  that will be attached to `:telemetry` package to consume and process generated measurements.

  ## Instrumentation
  `Membrane.Telemetry` publishes functions that return described below event names.

  The following events are published by Membrane's Core with following measurement types and metadata:

    * `[:membrane, :metric, :value]` - used to report metrics, such as input buffer's size inside functions, incoming events and received caps.
        * Measurement: `t:metric_event_value_t/0`
        * Metadata: `%{}`

    * `[:membrane, :link, :new]` - to report new link connection being initialized in pipeline.
        * Measurement: `t:new_link_event_value_t/0`
        * Metadata: `%{}`

  The measurements are reported only when application using Membrane Core specifies following in compile-time config file:

      config :membrane_core,
        enable_telemetry: true
