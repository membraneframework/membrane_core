  is returned from antoher callback.

  Untils the setup lasts, the component won't enter `:playing` playback.

  The timer's `id` is passed to the `c:Membrane.Bin.handle_tick/3`

  If `interval` is set to `:no_interval`, the timer won't issue any ticks until
  the interval is set with `t:timer_interval/0` action.

  Terminates bin with given reason.

  Termination reason follows the OTP semantics:
  - Use `:normal` for graceful termination. Allowed only when the parent already requested termination,
  i.e. after `c:Membrane.Bin.handle_terminate_request/2` is called. If the bin has no children, it
  terminates immediately. Otherwise, it switches to the zombie mode, requests all the children to terminate,
  waits for them to terminate and then terminates itself. In the zombie mode, no bin callbacks
  are called and all messages and calls to the bin are ignored (apart from Membrane internal
  messages)
  - If the reason is other than `:normal`, the bin terminates immediately. The bin supervisor
  terminates all the children with the reason `:shutdown`
  - If the reason is neither `:normal`, `:shutdown` nor `{:shutdown, term}`, an error is logged
