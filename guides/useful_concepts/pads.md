# Everything about pads

When developing some intuition about the structure of pipelines the pads are
something that can't be ignored. If you think about elements and bins as some
sort of containers in which some processing happens, then pads are the parts
that with these tanks are connected with. A pad of one element can only connect
to a single pad of other element and only once two pads are connected the media
can flow through them.
